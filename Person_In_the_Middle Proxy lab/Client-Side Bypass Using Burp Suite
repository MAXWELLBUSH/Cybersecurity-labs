Person-in-the-Middle Proxy Lab
Client-Side Bypass Using Burp Suite
📌 Overview

This lab focused on understanding Person-in-the-Middle (PITM) proxy techniques using Burp Suite to intercept and manipulate web traffic.
The objective was to bypass client-side security controls in a vulnerable web application by modifying HTTP requests before they reached the server.

The lab simulated a real-world scenario where a user with $0.00 account balance attempts to purchase expensive items by exploiting client-side trust flaws.

🎯 Lab Objectives

Understand how web traffic flows between a browser and a server

Configure and use Burp Suite as an intercepting proxy

Intercept HTTP requests and modify parameters

Bypass client-side validation logic

Demonstrate why server-side validation is critical

🛠️ Tools & Environment

Operating System: Kali Linux

Proxy Tool: Burp Suite Community Edition

Browser: Firefox (configured with proxy)

Lab Environment: Localhost vulnerable web application

Shell: training-shell

🧩 Lab Scope

Only challenges under the Logic Flaws section were attempted:

Client-Side Bypass

Proxy Interception

⚙️ Setup Steps
1️⃣ Start the Lab Environment

In the training shell, the lab was verified to be running:

running


Confirmed that hub-2 was active.

2️⃣ Launch Burp Suite

Burp Suite was launched from the Kali system and configured with the default proxy listener:

127.0.0.1 : 8080

3️⃣ Configure Browser Proxy

The browser was manually configured to route traffic through Burp:

Proxy IP: 127.0.0.1

Port: 8080

Burp’s CA certificate was installed in the browser to allow HTTPS interception.

4️⃣ Enable Interception

In Burp Suite:

Proxy → Intercept → Intercept is ON


This allowed Burp to pause requests before they reached the server.

🔍 Exploitation Process (Step-by-Step)
Step 1: Attempt Normal Purchase

Logged in as user: student

Account balance: $0.00

Attempted to add expensive items to the cart

The application blocked the action using client-side validation

Step 2: Intercept “Add to Cart” Request

When clicking Add to Cart, Burp intercepted a request similar to:

POST /add-to-cart HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

product_id=5&price=1500&quantity=1

Step 3: Modify Request Parameters

The request was edited directly inside Burp:

Original:
product_id=5&price=1500&quantity=1

Modified:
product_id=5&price=1&quantity=1

Step 4: Forward the Request

After modification, the Forward button was clicked.

✅ The item successfully appeared in the shopping cart
✅ The server accepted the manipulated price
✅ Client-side controls were bypassed

🧠 Key Discoveries

Client-side validation can be bypassed easily

Burp Suite allows full visibility and modification of web traffic

Servers that trust client input are vulnerable

Prices, balances, and permissions should never be enforced on the client

📚 What I Learned

How proxies work in web security testing

How HTTP requests are structured (headers + body)

How attackers manipulate POST and GET parameters

Why HTTPS does not protect against logic flaws

The importance of server-side validation

🚨 Real-World Attacker Use

In real applications, attackers can use this technique to:

Purchase items for free

Bypass payment checks

Manipulate account balances

Exploit discount and coupon systems

Commit financial fraud

This exact vulnerability has caused real financial losses in production systems.

🔐 How Applications Can Be Secured

To prevent this attack:

✅ Enforce server-side validation

✅ Never trust client-sent values (price, role, balance)

✅ Recalculate prices on the server

✅ Use integrity checks or server-side sessions

✅ Log and monitor suspicious request manipulation

🧪 Lab Outcome

✔ Successfully intercepted HTTP traffic

✔ Modified sensitive parameters

✔ Bypassed client-side controls

✔ Completed purchase with $0 balance

🏁 Conclusion

This lab demonstrated how logic flaws combined with client-side trust can lead to serious vulnerabilities.
Using Burp Suite as a proxy provided hands-on understanding of how attackers exploit weak validation and why secure applications must enforce controls on the server.
