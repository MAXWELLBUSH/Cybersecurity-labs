# Cybersecurity Physical Security Lab Project

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a **cybersecurity lab focused on physical security assessment**. It simulates a real-world environment where an attacker or penetration tester evaluates physical defenses such as walls, surveillance cameras, access points, and maintenance areas to identify weaknesses that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access.

The lab emphasizes **security mindset development**, threat modeling, reconnaissance, and documentation rather than actual intrusion. It is designed strictly for **educational and ethical purposes**.

---

## 2. Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

* To understand how physical security integrates with cybersecurity
* To identify physical vulnerabilities such as camera blind spots and unsecured access points
* To practice reconnaissance and observation techniques
* To demonstrate how attackers chain small weaknesses into successful access
* To improve documentation and reporting skills

---

## 3. Scope of the Lab

This lab focuses on **physical security testing**, including:

* Surveillance camera placement and blind spots
* Perimeter defenses (walls, trees, obstacles)
* Maintenance areas and closets
* Human-factor weaknesses (maintenance schedules, disguises)

### Out of Scope

* Network exploitation
* Malware development
* Credential attacks
* Real-world unauthorized access

## 4. Lab Environment Description

### 4.1 Outer Wall

* Approximately **15 feet tall**
* Equipped with **security cameras** placed at regular intervals
* Cameras provide wide coverage but contain **small blind spots**
* West side is blocked by a large tree
* East side may contain potential unsecured entrances

### 4.2 Maintenance Closet

* Contains maintenance tools and supplies
* Items present:

  * Folding ladder
  * Cleaning supplies
* Maintenance schedule posted on the door
* Cabinet with a **weak lock**

This area represents a common real-world oversight where operational convenience creates security risks.

## 5. Threat Model

### 5.1 Attacker Profile

* Insider threat or external attacker with limited access
* No advanced tools
* Relies on observation, timing, and social engineering

### 5.2 Attack Goals

* Bypass perimeter security
* Avoid surveillance detection
* Gain access without triggering alarms

---

## 6. Methodology

The lab follows a structured penetration testing approach:

### 6.1 Reconnaissance

* Observing camera placement
* Identifying blind spots
* Mapping obstacles and entry points
* Reviewing posted maintenance schedules

### 6.2 Vulnerability Identification

* Camera blind spots
* Tall walls without anti-climb measures
* Weak cabinet locks
* Unrestricted access to maintenance equipment

### 6.3 Exploitation (Simulated)

* Using environmental tools (ladder) to bypass height restrictions
* Exploiting blind spots to avoid camera detection
* Leveraging maintenance supplies for disguise

### 6.4 Post-Access Analysis

* Evaluating how access was achieved
* Identifying which controls failed
* Proposing mitigations

---

## 7. Key Findings

* Surveillance coverage does not guarantee full visibility
* Physical security often fails due to convenience
* Maintenance areas are high-risk zones
* Simple tools can defeat complex systems when poorly configured

---

## 8. Security Recommendations

### 8.1 Surveillance Improvements

* Eliminate camera blind spots
* Add overlapping camera coverage
* Perform regular camera audits

### 8.2 Perimeter Hardening

* Install anti-climb features on walls
* Remove environmental aids such as trees near walls

### 8.3 Access Control

* Secure maintenance areas with strong locks
* Restrict access to ladders and tools
* Avoid posting sensitive schedules publicly

### 8.4 Operational Security

* Rotate maintenance schedules
* Train staff on social engineering risks

---

## 9. Ethical Considerations

This project was conducted strictly for **educational purposes**. No real systems were harmed, and no unauthorized access occurred. All scenarios are simulated to promote ethical cybersecurity practices.

---

## 10. Skills Demonstrated

* Physical security assessment
* Threat modeling
* Security documentation
* Critical thinking and analysis
* Defensive security planning

---

## 11. Learning Outcomes

By completing this lab, the learner gains:

* Awareness of physical security risks
* Ability to identify non-technical vulnerabilities
* Understanding of how physical and cyber security intersect
* Experience writing professional security reports

---

## 12. Conclusion

This lab demonstrates that **security is only as strong as its weakest link**. Even advanced surveillance systems can be undermined by overlooked physical and human factors. Proper planning, auditing, and awareness are essential for effective security.

## 13. Disclaimer

This project is intended for **academic and training purposes only**. Any attempt to replicate these techniques on real-world systems without authorization is illegal and unethical.
